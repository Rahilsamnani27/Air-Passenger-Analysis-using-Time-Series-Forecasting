Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing air passenger traffic using time series forecasting techniques, specifically the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. The dataset used for this analysis is the famous "Air Passengers" dataset, which contains monthly totals of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960.

Objectives

1)Explore and visualize the time series data.
2)Check for stationarity and perform necessary transformations.
3)Fit an ARIMA model to forecast future passenger traffic.
4)Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Dataset

The dataset consists of:
1)Time period: 1949-1960
2)Frequency: Monthly
3)Variable: Number of air passengers per month

The general steps to implement an ARIMA model:

1)Load and prepare data
2)Check for stationarity (make data stationary if necessary) and determine d value
3)Create ACF and PACF plots to determine p and q values
4)Fit ARIMA model
5)Predict values on test set
6)Calculate rÂ²

Results

The model successfully captures the trend and seasonality of the data and the forecasted values closely align with actual observations within an acceptable margin of error.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of time series forecasting using ARIMA for air passenger data. The approach can be extended to other time series datasets for predictive analysis.
